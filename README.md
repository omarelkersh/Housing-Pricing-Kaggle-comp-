## Description

Predicting House Sale Prices is a machine learning project aimed at estimating the sale prices of houses based on various features. Leveraging Python and popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and plotly, this project takes users through the complete data science pipeline.

### Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights into the factors influencing house prices.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling.
  
- **Modeling:** Build and train predictive models using scikit-learn to estimate house sale prices. Experiment with different algorithms and configurations.
  
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) metric, with results presented in the `evaluation.ipynb` notebook.
  
- **Usage Guide:** Provide clear instructions on how users can explore, run, and customize the project for their own datasets.
