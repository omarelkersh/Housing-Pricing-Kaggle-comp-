# Housing Data Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features. The dataset used in this project includes information such as the type of dwelling, zoning classification, lot size, and many other factors.

Prerequisites
Python (3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook (for exploring and running the code)
Required Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, plotly, etc. (Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt)
Data Description
The dataset used in this project consists of the following columns:

SalePrice: the property's sale price in dollars (target variable)
MSSubClass: The building class
MSZoning: The general zoning classification
...
A detailed description of each column is available in the data_description.txt file.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features, relationships, and potential patterns. Visualizations and analyses are available in the Jupyter Notebooks.

Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The data preprocessing steps are detailed in the preprocessing.ipynb notebook.

Modeling
Build and train predictive models to estimate house sale prices. The modeling process is detailed in the modeling.ipynb notebook.

Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) metric. The evaluation results are presented in the [evaluation.ipyn
